# Number-Theory, give integers super-powers!

Number-Theory is a package to provide various integer facilities:
  - Multiprecision ints: int128, uint128, int256, uint256, ...
  - Infinite precision ints
  - Modular arithmetic
  - Primes algorithms: Miller-Rabin, Efficient prime sieves, ...
  - and more: elliptic curves, diophantine equations ...

It is primarily driven by my need of efficient cryptography-related integer functions.
